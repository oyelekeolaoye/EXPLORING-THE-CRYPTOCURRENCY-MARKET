# EXPLORING-THE-CRYPTOCURRENCY-MARKET
This project aims to get a grasp of the level of volatility in the crypto market.

This is a part of DataCamp's structured projects. In this project, the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies is explored with the aim of gaining an overview of the volatility of coins and also identifying the coins with the highest and lowest market capitalizations and by what amount do they differ via plots.

My main motivation for completing this project is to practise my data manipulation skills in pandas. After completing this project, some of the extra skills I gained is building lambda functions, using the axes class of the matplotlib module amongst others.

I hope you have fun reading!
